# WiFi Mapping Data Lake Architecture

This document outlines the high-level architecture and storage format of a scalable, DePIN-style WiFi mapping system. The design breaks data into three core storage buckets with separation between raw, processed, and query-optimized data.

---

## 📦 Bucket Overview

### 1. `raw-observations/`

**Purpose:** Store original user uploads for auditing, deduping, and historical access.

**Structure:**

```
raw-observations/{user_id}/{filehash}.csv
```

Or optionally:

```
raw-observations/{YYYY-MM-DD}/{user_id}/{filehash}.csv
```

**Notes:**

- Use file hashes to detect and prevent duplicate uploads.
- Keep original CSV format (e.g., Wigle style) for transparency.

---

### 2. `processed-data/`

**Purpose:** Store deduplicated, enriched observations, organized by H3 index and time.

**Structure:**

```
processed-data/h3/{resolution}/{h3_cell}/{YYYY-MM-DD}.jsonl
processed-data/h3/{resolution}/{h3_cell}/latest.json (optional)
```

**Example File Content (\*\***`.jsonl`\***\*):**

```json
{"bssid": "00:11:22:33:44:55", "lat": 52.368121, "lon": 4.903845, "rssi": -56, "timestamp": 1713093212, "user_id": "uA1b", "samples": 3}
{"bssid": "00:11:22:33:44:55", "lat": 52.368133, "lon": 4.903882, "rssi": -62, "timestamp": 1713093400, "user_id": "uC9z", "samples": 1}
```

And the UTC location stuff you were talking about can live here as well.

**`latest.json`\*\*** Example:\*\*

```json
{
	"latest_day": "2025-04-14",
	"last_modified": 1713133600,
	"file_size_bytes": 134297
}
```

**Notes:**

- Appending or rewriting per H3/day is fine depending on format.
- This is the raw material used to build the AP index.
- Metadata files help batch jobs efficiently detect recent updates.

---

### 3. `ap-index/`

**Purpose:** Query-optimized storage of estimated access point locations.

**Structure:**

```
ap-index/bssid/{prefix}/{bssid}.json
```

Where `prefix = bssid[:2]` for distribution.

**Example File Content:**

```json
{
	"bssid": "00:11:22:33:44:55",
	"lat": 52.3687,
	"lon": 4.9032,
	"accuracy_m": 12,
	"samples": 27,
	"first_seen": 1712800000,
	"last_seen": 1713123456,
	"source_cells": ["8a2a1072b59ffff", "8a2a1072b5affff"],
	"mobility": false
}
```

**Notes:**

- This file is overwritten on each rebuild.
- Perfect for edge caching, CDN storage, or in-memory querying.
- May later support mobility tracking with multi-location files.

---

## 🔁 Update Cycle

1. **User uploads** CSV to `raw-observations/`
2. **Async worker** parses, deduplicates, and writes to `processed-data/`
3. **Scheduled batch job** reads updated `processed-data/` entries and rebuilds `ap-index/`

Optional:

- Use `latest.json` to scan only recently updated H3s
- Store daily `/manifests/YYYY-MM-DD.json` to track changes globally

---

## 🚀 Caching Strategies

- `ap-index/` files can be cached at the edge (e.g., Cloudflare Workers)
- Hot BSSIDs can be stored in Redis for rapid server-side access
- Entire `/ap-index/` can live in CDN or KV store for DB-free querying

---

## 🧠 Notes

- Use Parquet or MsgPack for high-performance versions of processed data
- File naming schemes support long-term S3 tiering, partition pruning, and low-cost analytics
- `processed-data/` can be backfilled or reprocessed without impacting live APIs

---

## 🎯 Contributor Reward System (DePIN Model)

### 🧭 Goal: Reward fresh, unique, and valuable WiFi mapping contributions

### ✅ When to Calculate Contributions

- Right after row normalization during async ingestion
- Reward logic is applied **before final write to \*\***`processed-data/`\*\*
- Validation ensures timestamps are within 48 hours of current time

### 📏 Value Signals & Scoring

| Factor                     | Why It Matters                   | Example | Points |
| -------------------------- | -------------------------------- | ------- | ------ |
| New BSSID in H3 cell       | Expands network coverage         | 10      | 10     |
| Refreshed BSSID (14+ days) | Keeps dataset up-to-date         | 3       | 3      |
| RSSI > -70                 | High confidence observation      | -60     | +2     |
| New H3 Cell observed       | Geographic expansion             |         | +1     |
| Seen by multiple users     | Helps validate data authenticity |         | +2     |

### 🛠 Implementation

- Contributions are scored per row
- Minimal deduplication at ingestion: **allow overlapping observations** if:
  - Timestamp is different
  - RSSI is different
  - Coordinates vary within same H3
- Allows mapping of buildings, rooms, and overlapping coverage

### 🧮 Scoring System

```python
if timestamp > now - 48h:
    if not in_contributions(bssid, h3):
        score = 10
    elif last_contributed > 14 days:
        score = 3
    else:
        score = 0

    if rssi > -70:
        score += 2
    if is_new_h3_cell(user_id, h3):
        score += 1
    if seen_by_multiple_users(bssid, h3):
        score += 2
```

### 📋 Final Contribution Record

```json
{
	"bssid": "00:11:22:33:44:55",
	"h3_cell": 6222362798271,
	"lat": 52.3687,
	"lon": 4.9032,
	"rssi": -60,
	"timestamp": 1713105600,
	"user_id": "xyz123",
	"samples": 3,
	"contribution_score": 14
}
```

Stored in:

```sql
CREATE TABLE contributions (
    id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
    user_id TEXT,
    bssid TEXT,
    h3_cell BIGINT,
    timestamp BIGINT,
    score INT,
    status TEXT  -- e.g. 'new', 'refresh', 'duplicate'
);
```

Track contribution history with:

```sql
CREATE TABLE h3_bssid_map (
    bssid TEXT NOT NULL,
    h3_cell BIGINT NOT NULL,
    last_contributed BIGINT,
    PRIMARY KEY (bssid, h3_cell)
);
```

### 🔄 Optimization Tips

- Use Redis for fast `h3_bssid_map` lookups, mirror to PG for durability
- Future enhancements: seasonal bonuses, badge unlocks, mapping quests
